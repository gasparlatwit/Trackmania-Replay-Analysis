# Trackmania-Replay-Analysis
# Operating Systems final project
# Meant to read test log files produced with Minhs2's input visualizer 
# https://github.com/Minhs2/TM-Gbx-input-visualizer
# Exports a csv file containing analysis of log and and attempts to determines if inputs are result of script or game speed alteration (flip frequency kinda works)
# you can change the thresholds for tuning
# Thanks
